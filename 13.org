** What are PIC chips?
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: research
:END:
Peripheral Interface Controllers are small silicon chips which can be programmed to perform useful tasks.
In school, we tend to use Genie branded chips, like the C08 model you will use in this project. Others (e.g. PICAXE) are available.
PIC chips allow you connect different inputs (e.g. switches) and outputs (e.g. LEDs, motors and speakers), and to control them using flowcharts.
Chips such as these can be found everywhere in consumer electronic products, from toasters to cars. 

While they might not look like much, there is more computational power in a single PIC chip used in school than there was in the space shuttle that went to the moon in the 60's!
** When would I use a PIC chip?
Imagine you wanted to make a flashing bike light; using an LED and a switch alone, you'd need to manually push and release the button to get the flashing effect. A PIC chip could be programmed to turn the LED off and on once a second.
In a board game, you might want to have an electronic dice to roll numbers from 1 to 6 for you. 
In a car, a circuit is needed to ensure that the airbags only deploy when there is a sudden change in speed, AND the passenger is wearing their seatbelt, AND the front or rear bumper has been struck. PIC chips can carry out their instructions very quickly, performing around 1000 instructions per second - as such, they can react far more quickly than a person can. 
* Introduction

- The last question in the exam is normally a multi-part long answer question which requires you to produce a design to solve a specific problem. To score highly, you will be required to independently combine electronics, mechanisms and knowledge of resistant materials.

- *Specimen Paper, Q7.* A closed circuit surveillance system has a fixed camera. This is a limited system and requires modifying for improved surveillance. The mass of the camera is 10kg.
     - (a) With the aid of sketches, show a mechanical system that would be capable of slowly rotating the camera through an angle of 270 degrees. The system should be driven by an electric motor. /(8 marks)/
     - (b) Draw a control circuit that would allow the direction of rotation of the motor to be reversed. The circuit should include a method of automatically reversing the motor when the limits of the camera’s rotation are reached. /(10 marks)/
     - (c) With the aid of sketches, design a system that would make the camera tilt through an angle of approximately 45 degrees. The camera should remain in position when the power source is removed from the tilt system. /(6 marks)/
     - (d) Incorporate your ideas from parts (a), (b) and (c) into a design for a complete system that would allow the camera 270 degrees of rotation and 45 degrees of tilt. Show how this could be mounted on a bracket connected to the corner of a building. Marks will be awarded for:
         - Assembly of the sub-systems. /(8 marks)/
         - The design of the bracket. /(4 marks)/
         - Materials and construction. /(4 marks)/


- *2009, Q9.* The photograph below shows a bollard which can be manually moved to allow a vehicle to drive over it. This is a limited system and requires modifying for improved ease of use. 
[[./img/2009_q9.png]]
      - Height of bollard = 1000 mm 
      - Cross-section of bollard = 80 mm × 80 mm 
      - Mass of bollard = 10 kg

- (a) With the aid of sketches, show a mechanical system that would be capable of slowly lowering the bollard into a hole in the ground. The system should be powered by an electric motor. (8)

- (b) Draw a control circuit that would allow the direction of the motor to be reversed. The circuit must include a method of automatically stopping the motor when the bollard is at the limits of its travel. (8)

- (c) With the aid of sketches, design a system that would automatically illuminate four LEDs on the bollard during the hours of darkness. (6)

- (d) Incorporate your ideas from parts (a), (b) and (c) to show how the systems could be connected or arranged to operate as a complete unit. (10)

- (e) Explain any problems that might be encountered in the installation or manufacture of your system. (4)

- (f) List suitable materials for the major parts of your system including the bollard. (4)


- *2010, Q7.* The diagram shows a sliding door that is required to open as a person approaches. The door is shown in the closed position.
[[./img/2010_q7.png]]

- (a) With the aid of an annotated sketch, show how a person approaching the door could be detected and an output produced which would be suitable for activating the door control system. /(6 marks)/
- (b) With the aid of annotated sketches, show a system that would be capable of slowly opening and closing the door. /(8 marks)/
- (c) With the aid of a diagram, show a control system that would open the door when a person approaches and only close the door when the person has safely passed through. /(10 marks)/
- (d) Incorporate your ideas from parts (a), (b) and (c) into a design for a complete system that automatically opens the door when a person approaches and only closes it when they have safely passed through. Marks will be awarded for:
      - materials and construction /(4 marks)/

    - (a) With the aid of a diagram, show a sensing system that would produce an electrical output proportional to the water level in the river. /(4 marks)/
    - (b) With the aid of annotated sketches, show two methods of converting the movement of the water in the river into rotary motion. /(6 marks)/
    - (c) With the aid of an annotated sketch, show a system that would be capable of producing an electrical pulse for each rotation of a shaft. /(4 marks)/
    - (d) With the aid of a diagram, show how the number of electrical pulses per minute can be counted and displayed. /(10 marks)/
    - (e) Using this page and the next page incorporate your ideas from parts (a), (b), (c) and (d) into a design for a complete system that automatically indicates the level of the river and displays an output to indicate the speed of flow of the water. Marks will be awarded for:
