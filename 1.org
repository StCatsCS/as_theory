** What are PIC chips?
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: research
:END:
Peripheral Interface Controllers are small silicon chips which can be programmed to perform useful tasks.
In school, we tend to use Genie branded chips, like the C08 model you will use in this project. Others (e.g. PICAXE) are available.
PIC chips allow you connect different inputs (e.g. switches) and outputs (e.g. LEDs, motors and speakers), and to control them using flowcharts.
Chips such as these can be found everywhere in consumer electronic products, from toasters to cars. 

While they might not look like much, there is more computational power in a single PIC chip used in school than there was in the space shuttle that went to the moon in the 60's!
** When would I use a PIC chip?
Imagine you wanted to make a flashing bike light; using an LED and a switch alone, you'd need to manually push and release the button to get the flashing effect. A PIC chip could be programmed to turn the LED off and on once a second.
In a board game, you might want to have an electronic dice to roll numbers from 1 to 6 for you. 
In a car, a circuit is needed to ensure that the airbags only deploy when there is a sudden change in speed, AND the passenger is wearing their seatbelt, AND the front or rear bumper has been struck. PIC chips can carry out their instructions very quickly, performing around 1000 instructions per second - as such, they can react far more quickly than a person can.

** Ohm's Law
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: learn
:END:
- Before you can do anything to design and create new, original projects, you'll need to understand three fundamental electronic concepts. 
- *Voltage*, is the difference in energy level between two points in a circuit, which will allow electrons to move through a conductor. The more difference in energy levels there is, the larger the amount of current can be drawn, and the larger item they can power. A basic red LED might only need 2.7V to run, whereas a laptop might need 24V, and a large electric motor moving a lift might need 415V to operate. 
#+BEGIN_HTML
<br>
#+END_HTML
- **Current** is a measure of how many electrons pass a particular point in the circuit per second. Higher current (/measured in Amps/) means faster electron flow in the circuit. The process of moving electrons through a material generates frictional heat. If the wire used in a product is too thin, and too much current passes through it, the wire will melt! This is the principal on which fuses are made. 
#+BEGIN_HTML
<br>
#+END_HTML
- **Resistance** is a measure of to what extent a material resists the flow of current in a circuit, and is measured in Ohms. Good conductors of electricity (like copper and gold) have very low resistance (1-2 \Omega{}), and insulators (like rubber and plastic) have a high resistance (several million Ohms).

- Another explanation of the concepts can be seen over at [[https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/voltage-current-resistance-and-ohms-law][SparkFun]]. 
- Ohm's law is the mathematical formula that shows the relationship between Voltage (V), Current (I) and Resistance (R). 
  - *V = IR*
#+BEGIN_HTML
<br>
#+END_HTML

- In the exam, you'll sometimes be asked to calculate one of the values, given two of the others.
- E.g. /According to its datasheet, an LED can take a maximum of 2.5v, and has a safe current of up to 20mA. If powered by a 6v battery, what size resistor will be needed to protect it?/
- LEDs have very low internal resistance, and will blow instantaneously if they try and handle all too much current.
#+BEGIN_HTML
<br>
#+END_HTML
- If we have a 6V potential difference in the circuit, we need to remove 3.5V (6V - 2.5V) from the circuit, to leave 2.5V for the LED. *V=2.5*
- Just like any other physics question, we need to use the correct SI unit to perform our calculation. 1000mA = 1A, so 100mA = 0.1A, 10mA = 0.01A and so 20mA = 0.02A. *I = 0.02*
- We now have values for V and I, and we need to find R. Through basic re-arrangement, our formula becomes: *R = V / I*
  - R = V / I
  - R = 3.5 / 0.02
  - R = 175\Omega
#+BEGIN_HTML
<br>
#+END_HTML
- It turns out that 175Ω isn’t a standard resistor size we can buy, so we go to the next largest size, which is 180Ω (220Ω would also work here).
** Electrical Power
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: try
:END:
- Power is the product of Voltage and Current, and is measured in Watts. This is expressed mathematically as:
  - P = V I

- *Example Use:* Is a 0.25W resistor adequate for the LED example above? 
  - The amount of power the resistor has to dissipate can be calculated as… 
  - P = 3.5 x 0.02 = *0.07W*
  - So a 0.25W resistor would be suitable. In fact, it would be suitable for carrying the current of up to 3 LEDs. 

** Series and Parallel Resistance 
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: learn
:END:
- *Resistors in Series*
- To calculate the overall resistance achieved when connecting together resistors in series, we add them together. E.g.
  - R_{T} = R_{1} + R_{2}
- Example: Two resistors are connected together in series in a circuit. The colour codes on the first resistor is green, blue, black, gold. The colour code on the second resistor has been rubbed off. When a multi-meter is placed across both resistors, the meter reads 276Ω. What is the resistance of the unmarked resistor?
  - 276 = 56 + R_{2}
  - R_{2} = 276 - 56 = 220\Omega 
#+BEGIN_HTML
<br>
#+END_HTML
- *Resistors in Parallel*
  - 1/R_{T} = 1/R_{1} + 1/R_{2} + 1/R_{3}…
** The Potential Divider
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: learn
:END:
- A potential divider allows engineers to reduce the amount of voltage in a circuit. This is one of the most elemental circuits, and is used in various forms in PIC circuit design.
[[./img/pot_div.png]]
- V_{1} = (R_{1} / (R_{1} + R_{2})) x Supply voltage (V_{S})
- V_{2} = (R_{2} / (R_{1} + R_{2})) x Supply Voltage (V_{S})
#+BEGIN_HTML
<br>
#+END_HTML
- By placing two resistors in series, different voltages can be achieved.
- This is handy when connecting analogue sensors to PIC chips. 
- It's also useful to put a PD before the base of a transistor (come back to this statement later in the course when you've covered more of the theory!) to trigger different components.
  - While only a low current is available (resistors reduce current flow), having an LDR (resistance increases as light level drops) and a fixed (usually 10k) resistor in a potential divider setup will allow varying amounts of voltage to be sent into the analogue pin of the PIC.
  - The Genie PIC chips we have contain an 8-bit ADC (Analogue to Digital Convertor), which convert a voltage between 0-5V to a number between 0 and 255.
[[./img/ldr.png]]
  - When the light level is very high (/1000 [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lux][lux]] in the shot above/), the resistance in the LDR drops to around 400\Omega. As a result, most of the electrical energy in the potential divider will flow into the analogue input, as this is easier than having to travel through a 10k resistor. 
  - In this case, is we asuming 400\Omega of resistance through the LDR, and a 10k\Omega resistor are forming a potential divider, we can use the first of the formulae shown above...
      1. V_{1} = (R_{1} / (R_{1} + R_{2})) x Supply voltage (V_{S})
      2.  V_{1} = (10000 / (10000 + 400)) x 5
      3.  V_{1} = (10000 / 10400) x 5
      4.  V_{1} = 0.962 x 5
      5.  V_{1} = 4.81
#+BEGIN_HTML
<br>
#+END_HTML
- There would be a 4.81V potential difference at V_{1}. 
  - The ADC will interpret this through a simple process...
    - 4.81 / 5 = 0.962 (5 is the input voltage for the PIC in this demo)
    - 0.962 * 255 = *245.31*
    - So we report to the PIC chip that we've got an analogue reading of 245. 
#+BEGIN_HTML
<br>
#+END_HTML
- When the light level drops, the LDR's resistance will rise up to a few million Ohms. This will mean that by the time current has passed through the LDR, much of the energy will have been dissipated (in the form of heat), leaving a much smaller potential difference between the analogue input and 0V. The ADC will interpret this voltage as a low number.
#+BEGIN_HTML
<br>
#+END_HTML
- Despite the temptation to do so, a PD  *isn't* suitable for creating power rails that need to power a load (e.g. Stepping down 12V to 3V to drive a motor), as all the current you'd need to draw will also have to pass through R_{2} first.

1. A 9v DC motor motor rated at 0.673A is to be powered by a 12v supply. What size resistor should be used to make it run at it’s maximum speed?
2. 	i) A 60W lightbulb in a house is running on a standard 240v AC power supply. How much current does it draw?
	ii) UK fuses can be 1A, 3A, 5A or 13A. This refers to how much current can be drawn through the fuse without it “blowing”. What size fuse should be fitted to a 1600W hairdryer?
3. A circuit being designed has a 12v supply, but needs a 3v rail, to be made with a potential divider. Suggest two resistor values that could provide this, and confirm it in circuit wizard.
4. What’s the overall resistance achieved by connecting together 3 100Ω resistors in series in a circuit?
